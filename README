This is the Github repository for the dream programming language.
It is being developed for the PL101 course being run at nathansuniversity.com.

Dream is being designed to be a simple easy-to-learn language specialised for the creation of games.
It will borrow from such languages as Google Go, Scala, MATLAB and DOT (a graph definition language).
